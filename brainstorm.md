# App Idea Brainstorming
## App Ideas List
1. **Mobile Anime App**
    - Be able to view and search for anime
    - Be able to view the top rated shows on a page
    - Be able to favorite an anime
    - Be able to mark a show as watching or completed 
2. **Calendar App**
    - Similiar to Google Calendar/Reminder app
    - I guess it is similar to building on top of the tasks app
    - Users inputs tasks/important events and the app will notify them if the deadline is close
3. **Health Fitness App**
    - Helps users with keeping up their fitness and be healthier in general

## Evaluating App Ideas
### Top Two App Ideas
1. **Mobile Anime App**
2. **Calendar App**

### Evaluating Ideas
1. **Mobile Anime App**
   - **Mobile:** I would not necessarily say that this type of app needs to be mobile. There are indeed many web apps that serve the same purpose, but there are fewer mobile apps. This essentially serves as an alternative for people to use if they would rather use a mobile app.
   - **Story:** Users can search for any interesting shows they plan on watching next and can organize their anime list so they easily sort through and find shows.
   - **Market:** Any person who has interests in anime and watches it on a regular basis
   - **Habit:** Users would typically use this during their free time whenever they plan on watching a show. It is not necessarily something they would be constantly using it, but something they will use when they need it.
   - **Scope:** The functionality I wanted to implement should not be too difficult to implement within this timeframe even if I run into other busy assignments. The tasks builds upon what we have learned in the course with using APIs, table views, navigation, etc so it is good project to do for a capstone. It is not too simple nor too complex and if needed more functionality can be added during the development process as well. 
2. **Calendar App**
   - **Mobile:** For the purpose of this app, mobile is better. Since this app serves to help a user organize their schedule and get reminders anything important that is upcoming, it is more beneficial for it to be mobile. People are more likely to carry around and have access to a phone compared to a computer.
   - **Story:** Helps users with organization and manage their time wisely. Sends reminders to user so they are aware of everything they need to do and complete ahead of time.
   - **Market:** Any person can use it. Anyone who would like an easy way to organize their schedule would be interested.
   - **Habit:** People would probably check this quite often to figure out what they have to get done over the next few days or so.
   - **Scope:** This might be a little difficult to complete within the rest of the time simply because it has features that was never taught in the course. I am not sure how long it would actually take me to learn and figure out some of the features.

### Final Decision
**Mobile Anime App**
- It is both feasible and frankly something I am more interested in than the other ideas.
